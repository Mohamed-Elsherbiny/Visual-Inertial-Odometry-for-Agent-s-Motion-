# Visual-Inertial-Odometry-for-Agent-s-Motion-
Visual Odometry (VO) aims to continuously estimate the scaled pose (position and orientation) with respect to the camera body frame (c) of the moving body (drone – vehicle – Agent) using a pipeline of image frames. Some cameras that are used to perform this task are equipped with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which measures the linear accelerations and angular velocities with respect to the IMU body frame (i).
